  <p>The idea is to have a lot of repetition on the
  basic ideas on different types of problems. We believe it doesn’t help much
  to give one example only on how to use a given feature. For instance, knowing
  that the construct <code>s/foo/bar/</code> is used to search and replace text is easy to
  remember, but that doesn’t mean one has the necessary experience to use it to
  solve different problems.</p>

  <p>For instance, for a really beginner programmer, if he or she knows they can
  do <code>2 + 3 = 5</code> and that they can do <code>a = 2; b = 3;</code> and then proceed to
  <code>a + b = 5</code> doesn’t mean they’ll realise that they can also do <code>a + 3</code> and
  <code>2 + b</code> or even <code>a + -5</code>, for instance.</p>

  <p>I <strong>emphasize</strong>: lots of examples that keep reusing the same concepts to solve
  different problems really help one gain insight on how to use them for even
  more problems later much more than just memorizing “Ah, <code>s</code> is substitute”.</p>

  <p>In the book Mastering Regular Expressions the author says that a lot of stuff
  in the book are not about regex itself, but are about <strong>using</strong> regex. That is a really
  nice idea to cling to.</p>

  <p>I wish some IRC channels were more open to related subjects instead of being
  proud to shout “off-topic” to everything they possibly can.</p>
