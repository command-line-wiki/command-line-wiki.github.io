Write about trailling whitespace, how it is a nightmare for Git (and other)
and how it is not good for web stuff, since more bytes have to be transfered
over the network. Mention that whitespace is important, and should not be
used unless it makes sense. Whitespace between two words make sense; whitespace
at the end of lines do not.
