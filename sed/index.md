The idea is to have a lot of repetition on the basic ideas on different types
of problems. We believe it doesn't help much to give one example only on how to
use a given feature. Knowing that the construct `s/foo/bar/` is used to search
and replace text is easy to remember, but that doesn't mean one has the
necessary experience to use it to solve different problems.

For instance, for a really beginner programmer, if he or she knows they can
do `2 + 3 = 5` and that they can do `a = 2; b = 3;` and then proceed to
`a + b = 5` doesn't mean they'll realise that they can also do `a + 3` and
`2 + b` or even `a + -5`, for instance.

I **emphasize**: lots of examples that keep reusing the same concepts to solve
different problems really help one gain insight on how to use them for even
more problems later much more than just memorizing ``Ah, `s` is substitute''.

In the book Mastering Regular Expressions the author says that a lot of stuff
in the book are not about regex itself, but are about **using** regex. That is a really
nice idea to cling to.

I wish some IRC channels were more open to related subjects instead of being
proud to shout “off-topic” to everything they possibly can.
